Comparison of different predictive modeling methods on the detection of wildfires.


Ali Hossaini & Amber Benbow


Multiple studies have found that climate change has already led to an increase in wildfire season length, wildfire frequency, and burned area. The wildfire season has lengthened in many areas due to factors including warmer springs, longer summer dry seasons, and drier soils and vegetation which help make it more predictable. Having a more accurate fire prediction model than those currently available would aid officials in critical decision making regarding fires prior to a fire happening. Fire reduction strategies or early evacuations could hopefully be employed. In terms of geocomputing, I want to explore SVM & ML codes to predict this problem by confirming the success of different methods models at analyzing this information. By the end of this project, I hope to make this method replicable for different areas and/or different timeframes.
