Project Description:
  Multiple studies have found that climate change has already led to an increase in
  wildfire season length, wildfire frequency, and burned area. The wildfire season has
  lengthened in many areas due to factors including warmer springs, longer summer dry 
  seasons, and drier soils and vegetation which help make it more predictable. Having 
  a more accurate fire prediction model than those currently available would aid officials
  in critical decision making regarding fires prior to a fire happening. Fire reduction
  strategies or early evacuations could hopefully be employed. In terms of geocomputing,
  I want to explore SVM & ML codes to predict this problem by confirming the success
  of different methods models at analyzing this information. By the end of this project,
  I hope to make this method replicable for different areas and/or different timeframes.
